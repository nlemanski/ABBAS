To examine how the spatial distribution of resources interacts with individual behavior to shape collective foraging decisions,
we expanded on the ABBAS (Animal Behavior Based on Agents Simulations) model. This model simulates food patches with three different 
qualities, in two alternative distrubitions: clumped and dispersed. This model allows us to examine how forager persistence and the
behavioral composition of the colony (number of scouts) interact with landscape structure to influence the colony's collective choice
of which resource patches to exploit.
