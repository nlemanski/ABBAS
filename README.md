To examine the impact of individual variations in foraging behaviors, we
developed a spatially-explicit Agent-Based Model. ABBAS (Animal Behavior Based
on Agents Simulations) is a free software that simulates honey bees foraging in
a bidimensional space using Python's standard numerical libraries. It implements
a detailed flight dynamics based on stochastic diffusion processes, parametrized
following a wide range of experiments (see below for more details), and a
recruitment mechanism that mimics the [waggle dance in honey
bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance). Foragers were divided into
two groups, scouts and recruits, with each group having their own properties.
ABBAS provides an API to control the properties of each group easily and
schedule batches of simulations.

This software (v1.0) was used in a [recent
paper](https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS#relevant-papers) was used to study
the joint impact of task allocation and behavioral persistence on collective
behavior.

We have now expanded on this software (v2.0) to examine how the spatial distribution of resources influences the collective ability to choose among different quality resource patches. A preprint of this paper is available on [BioRxiv ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/817270v1).

#### We also [provide here](https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS/tree/master/documentation/ODD) a description of our model using the Overview, Design concepts, and Details (ODD) protocol.

## Sample code

As an example of how to use ABBAS, [we provide a sample code that
reproduces Figure 3a from our
paper](https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS/tree/master/documentation/Submitted%20Paper).
In this example,

* we set up an environmentwith an initial amount of resources,

* set up the hive (number of foragers, number of scouts, how persistent they are, etc),

* and simulate in parallel instances of the same scenario to estimate how much
* food the bees collected (collective outcome).

We then compile all of these results, estimating the average and standard
deviation of the collected food as a function of time. We finish with a fuzzy
plot of the average amount of resource collected and 1.5 standard deviations as
a function of time.
